# Writing a JSON Parser in TypeScript

This is the repository for the Medium blog post on writing a JSON parser in TypeScript. In the blog post, we walk through the process of writing a JSON parser from scratch and explain each step along the way.

If you'd like to see the full implementation of the JSON parser in TypeScript, The `json-parser.ts` file contains the main parser code, and the `json-parser.test.ts` file contains the unit tests.

We hope this repository is helpful to you in understanding how JSON parsing works and how to write your own JSON parser in TypeScript or any other language.
